# Birthday Homepage

This is a birthday homepage for my girlfriends 30s brithday party. It consists of information on the location, contact and a voting wheather the friends participate or not. It also collects information on the drinks.
The details of the voting are collected in a database in the django backend. 
The webside runs on my raspberry pi and it also informs me with an email, if new votings are available.
